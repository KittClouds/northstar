# RG2 Phase 9 — coverage and QC

**Decision: `HOLD_RG2_FOR_LIFECYCLE_COVERAGE_REVIEW`**

This report describes dataset geometry only. It contains no strategy labels, win rate, feature selection, or model.

## Corpus integrity

- Status: **PASS**
- Runs: 20 across 6 instruments and 1 data source
- Observed bars: 21,235 (1769.6 bar-hours)
- Scheduled window span: 2356.2 hours
- Data gaps: 0 unexpected; profile bar delta 0
- Replay: PASS (1 exact duplicate)
- Replay canonical hash agreement: True
- Relational invariant failures: 0
- Corpus fingerprint: `3de4a043f52ff997e3e8de9428a4bbfcb17d94b41935a2ce9b64ebc0dce80a34`

- Semantic result hash: `119d87d2be6d9b4337e6af0d7752596c61873c05598f4438514a016ec81574ae`

## Population

- Nodes: 2,294 created; 2,077 retired; 217 persisted at cutoff
- Events: 38,957
- Attempts: 7,764
- Episodes: 1,462 (1,434 resolved, 28 right-censored; 1.92%)
- Transits: 628
- Behavioral episode resolutions: 186 (12.72%)

## Principal geometry finding

- `NODE_RETIRED`: 853 resolved + 3 censored/provisional rows; 59.48% of resolved episodes.
- Those resolved retirement episodes begin on nodes with median age **5s**, median width **0.091 ATR**, and median duration **946s**; 692/853 begin before node age one hour.
- `TIMEOUT`: 395 resolved + 5 censored/provisional rows; 27.55% of resolved episodes.
- Those resolved timeout episodes begin on nodes with median age **4.46h**, median width **2.486 ATR**, and median duration **3.54h**; 240/395 are wider than 1 ATR.
- Structurally retired nodes have median observed lifetime **2.00h**. Nodes persisted at cutoff have median observed age **20.88h** and remain censored.
- This separation is descriptive. It does not establish whether lifecycle churn or grammar thresholds should change.

| Can RG2 support a predictive model? | corpus | 1462 | BLOCKED_BY_DESIGN | Phase 9 forbids modeling; outcome imbalance requires review |

## QC interpretation

- The corpus is coherent and replay-stable.
- Node retirement and timeout dominate episode resolution; that is a semantic coverage finding, not a trading result.
- Right-censored episodes may retain their latest provisional resolution. Completed behavioral evidence excludes those rows.
- Extreme regional cells and accepted/retest outcomes remain too sparse for conditional research.
- Percentages in coverage tables always retain counts and unit-specific censoring rates.
- Persisted nodes at cutoff are censored lifecycle observations, not inferred retirements.
